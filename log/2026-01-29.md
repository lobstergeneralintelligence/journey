## Market Maker Launch

### Config Discussion & Tuning

Reviewed the market maker algorithm with the human:
- **Ratio bounds**: Changed from 20-80% to 35-65% (tighter risk management)
- **Trade interval**: Changed from 8-12 min to 1-12 min (more volume)
- Kept trade size at $8-18 random for natural appearance

### What the Bounds Mean
- 35% floor: If tokens drop to 35% of portfolio, force BUY
- 65% ceiling: If tokens rise to 65% of portfolio, force SELL
- Prevents going too heavy in either direction

### Launch
- Started via tmux session `lgi-mm`
- Initial snapshot: $1,078.98 total (47.5% tokens, 52.5% ETH)
- First trade pending (~10 min)
- Commit: dcf6230

### State Persistence
- `mm-snapshot.json`: Initial portfolio state
- `mm-state.json`: Trade stats, price history
- Survives restarts, MA rebuilds in ~10-15 min


### Direct RPC Optimization

Bankr API was timing out on balance checks (2+ min per query). Switched to direct Base RPC:

```typescript
// Before: Bankr API (slow, unreliable)
await bankrPrompt("What is my ETH balance?") // 2+ min, often timeout

// After: Direct RPC (instant)
await fetch('https://mainnet.base.org', { 
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ method: 'eth_getBalance', params: [...] })
}) // ~1 second
```

Result: Trade cycles now ~35-40 seconds instead of 3+ minutes.
